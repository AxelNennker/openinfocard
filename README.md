This project implements a Firefox Extension that is an alternative to Microsoft's CardSpace (Infocard).<br/>

<br/>
The Firefox Extension is available on Mozilla's Addon Site<br/>
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/openinfocard-identity-selector/<br/>
<br/>
Although this does not work in current versions of Firefox because Mozilla ditched JAVA support in Firefox.<br/>

<br/>
JAVA was used because most of the crypto used in Infocards was not available in javascript at that time.<br/>
I guess that most of the functionality could by implemented today (2015) by using WebCrypto.<br/>
